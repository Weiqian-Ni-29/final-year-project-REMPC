This is the realization of EMPC with 3 cases in Matlab
The main file is empc3.m
make_RPI_set.m does not play any role in this scenario-based algorithm
make_new_disturbances.m generates the predicted disturbances 
noise_generation.m generates disturbances in real simulation
empc_obj3.m is the cost function used in fmincon
empc_nonlcon3.m is the non-linear constraint used in fmincon

Please find the 3 monitoring algorithms in their folders
