This is the realization of EMPC with 5 cases in Matlab
The main file is empc5.m
make_RPI_set.m generate the RPI set
make_new_disturbances.m generates the predicted disturbances 
noise_generation.m generates disturbances in real simulation
empc_obj5.m is the cost function used in fmincon
empc_nonlcon5.m is the non-linear constraint used in fmincon
